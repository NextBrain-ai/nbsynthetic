# Tabular synthetic data generator
Next Brain Synthetic or nbsyntehtic is a simple but robust tabular synthetic data generation library. Synthetic data generation is living a golden age in image generation applications. Since the introduction of [Generative Adversarial Networks]([url](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf)) by Ian J. Goodfellow in 2017, this algorithms have became essential en image generation, overperforming the already existing ones las Variation Autoencoders or Boltzman Machines.
